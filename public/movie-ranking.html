        <h1>My favourite recent movies</h1>
        <h2>These movies have recently left an impact on me</h2>
        <hr/>
        <h3>To kill a mockingbird</h3>
            <p>Simply a fantastic film seeped in the southern gothic genre.<br/>
               In the modern age it is both a shock and intrigue to see how casual the institutional racism affected public perception and law
            </p>
        <h3>The School for Good and Evil</h3>
            <p>
                Although this film could easily be written off as fanciful cliché and pre-teen trite,
                my partner and I found ourselves enamored with it's stylish presentation, themes of women empowerement
                and it's ability to strike a delicate balance between clichéd fairytale and modern storytelling.

        <h3>Interview with a vampire</h3>
        <p>
            This entry is due to a personal view point and comes at a very particular time.
            Interview with a vampire showcases a much less high-brow look into the Southern-Gothic genre.
            It plays on themes of the macabre while keeping a delightfully dark humor throughout it's runtime. With stars like Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise spearheading this homoerotic flick you are sure in for a treat.
